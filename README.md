Business Challenge/Requirement

Customer retention and acquisition strategies are on top of every organization’s agenda. 
To offer better customer service and boost loyalty, a company has to invest in a state-of-the-art CRM tool. 
In pursuit of these goals, every organization implements CRM as a strategy that integrates the concepts of data mining and data warehousing. 
The data collected through the CRM helps the leadership team make actionable decisions in real time.

Abstract
=============================

The company has multiple contact centers across India to provide support service to their customers

 • Customers can reach out to the care team over different communication channels depending on their preference and convenience: Calls, Chat, or Email. 
 • CCR (Customer Care Representative) registers the complaint by collecting all the necessary details - - which is called a case 
• A case can have a status -- open or closed 
• Each case can belong to a category and sub-category. This category and sub-category will determine case priority. Depending on the priority key, CCR has an SLA (in hours) to close the case within the SLA hours
 • Once a case is closed, the customer is sent a survey link to rate the overall experience of interacting with the contact center representative
 • The customer can take a survey or leave it unattended. The customer can rate the experience on a scale of 1-10 on various questions
 • Survey response is captured for that particular case
